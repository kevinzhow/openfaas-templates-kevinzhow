OpenFaaS Swift Static Template
=======================

### Why Swift?

Why not? Swift is as good a language as any to be used as a function.

### How to use

As this is not part of the official OpenFaaS templates you need to create your function first
copy clone this repo to the templates folder.

Edit your yml to set the language to swiftc

copy the function/handler.swift to your functionname directory.
